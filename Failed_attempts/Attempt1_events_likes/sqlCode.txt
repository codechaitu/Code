1) From the likes table, get user_id and item_id

SELECT  user_id, item_id,created  FROM `sage-shard-740.anon_jp.likes` WHERE created BETWEEN '2018-10-01 00:00:00' AND '2018-10-02 23:59:59' GROUP BY user_id,item_id,created  LIMIT 500000

2) From items table, 


(SELECT user_id,JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(prop, '$.item_id') as item_id,event_id, ctime, stime FROM `sage-shard-740.pascal_event_log.event_log_201810*` where  user_id is not null AND _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '01' and '02'  GROUP BY user_id, item_id,ctime,stime,event_id LIMIT 500000)  

3) For getting the counts of likes from each event

select distinct(event_id), count(event_id) as countNumber from 

(SELECT user_id, item_id, event_id, ctime, stime FROM `kouzoh-p-codechaitu.ModelBuilding.items`) as I JOIN

(SELECT user_id, item_id, created FROM `kouzoh-p-codechaitu.ModelBuilding.likes` ) as L ON

I.user_id = L.user_id and I.item_id = L.item_id  GROUP BY event_id ORDER BY countNumber DESC




4) Getting number of likes or dislikes



SELECT user_id, count(item_id) as lik from (

select  distinct I.user_id, I.item_id, if( I.user_id = L.user_id and I.item_id = L.item_id  ,1,0) as liked from 

(SELECT  distinct user_id, item_id, event_id, ctime, stime FROM `kouzoh-p-codechaitu.ModelBuilding.items`) as I LEFT JOIN

(SELECT distinct user_id, item_id, created FROM `kouzoh-p-codechaitu.ModelBuilding.likes` ) as L ON

I.user_id = L.user_id   and event_id = 'item_detail_display'  ) where liked = 0 group by user_id order by lik desc LIMIT 10000
